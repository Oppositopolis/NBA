How It Works:
GUI Elements:

Users can enter the NBA season (e.g., 2023-24).
A "Run Analysis" button triggers data fetching and analysis.
The results are saved to a file specified by the user using a file dialog.
Threaded Processing:

Data fetching runs in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive.
Data Saving:

Results are saved in a CSV file chosen by the user.
Error Handling:

Alerts the user if inputs are invalid or if an error occurs during data fetching.
Output:
The script generates a user-friendly interface, saves the analyzed data to a CSV file, and ensures a smooth interactive experience.
